tx.origin check is desired. Possible manipulations is allowed.* - This mean that tx.origin authorisation is best use-case for our vision of discount requirement. We want give discount only for transaction initiators that hold our governance token, not for contracts. If we will use msg.sender insted this is could open opportunities for scammers to create contracts with out token in balance to give users discount and manage their funds. We noticed about patterns when attacker could use tx.origin to call transaction as another user (fallback attack), but this scenario is not dangerous for our protocol economic or users funds. This manipulation could be totally ignored. But, in next versions of protocol we will change this logic to acheive best-case patterns and avoid to use tx.origin totally.

UPDATED now checks msg.send and ( msg.sender == tx.origin )

** - || UPDATED added some events and zero addresses cheks
